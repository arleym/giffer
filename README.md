Giffer
======

A quick and dirty Animated Gif presentation slide. Hit Esc to see listing.

### Usage
Load this bad boy up in your browser full screen. Hit ``esc`` to pick an image, then fiddle with the hacky URL to add a text title. Something like ``index.html?Title=Q1%20Review&Img=laughter`` (don't worry, your browser will add the ``%20`` space nonsense).

I made this for an event and thought I'd share it with the world. You can see a live [demo here](http://rle.me/misc/giffer/giffer.html?Title=Giffer%20-%20github.com/arleym/giffer&Img=happydance).

### Roadmap
I probably won't enhance this much, but if I was going to

- A menu icon toggle to show the gif list
- The flyout could include tools to change h1 visual styles; colour, style, etc.
- Choose some gifs from a select
- Ability to enter gif by full URL
- Custom CSS Block
- Save / Cookie would rock
- Some magic to automatically list the images in the sub folder would be sweet.
