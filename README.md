Giffer
======

A simple Animated Gif Presentation slide. Hit Esc to see listing. This is silly, and not very accessible.

### Usage
Load this up in your browser full screen. Hit ``esc`` to enter your settings including a title, background image, descriptive text, CSS, and choose if you'd like the image tiled or fullscreen.

You can see a live [demo here](http://rle.me/misc/giffer/index.html?title=Giffer!&img=http://rle.me/x/kicksad.gif&fullscreen=full).
